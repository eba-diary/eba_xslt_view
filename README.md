eba_xslt_view
=============

This view of the Emma B. Andrews TEI XML file is provided using an XSLT script that was built by one of the projects undergraduate researchers, Pranav Shivanna. This view is a dynamic listing of all the person name attributes in the volume 19 XML file. Underneath each name attribute are the different spellings of that name that occur in the text of the diary.
